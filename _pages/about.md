My research studies aim to investigate the relationship between entrepreneurial venture formation, including team formation and opportunity recognition processes. This research is based on the premise that the characteristics of the founding team and their environment play a crucial role in shaping these processes, which are central for the success of the venture, as they set the foundation for all subsequent decision-making, resource allocation, and growth. A multi-methodological approach is adopted to explore these topics, including field experiments, survey studies, and advanced econometric analysis. The results of these studies contribute to the existing literature in the fields of entrepreneurship and strategy by establishing causal inferences and advancing our theoretical understanding of the venture formation processes.
